                                    Due to the increasing capabilities of browsers, Web Apps are now
                                    able to solve more problems than ever before. One of the major
                                    perks of web apps is that customers can get a running instance
                                    of your product just by navigating to a page, no installation
                                    necessary. Furthermore technologies like Electron and
                                    Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) have made it possible leverage the
                                    benefits of Web Apps in a more traditional feeling package with
                                    offline functionality. Using web-tech to build your app is one
                                    of the easiest ways to maintain a high level of agility as well
                                    as ensuring your clients are always using the latest version of
                                    your app without annoying updates that interrupt their
                                    productivity.

                                    These days almost no technology is as familiar to users as
                                    Mobile apps. User's commonly search the app store for solutions
                                    to their problems and, unlike with some other platforms, an app
                                    store can market your app for you! Mobile apps also benefit from
                                    the tremendous amount of contextual data provided to them from
                                    the user's phone, be it something passive like location or the
                                    ability to have users take photos and receive notifications.
                                    Mobile apps are at the forefront of cutting edge user
                                    experiences and can arguably create a more intimiate experience
                                    than any other platform.

                                    Cross-Platform apps let users interact with your app wherever
                                    they are. In many cases a Web app designed as a PWA will provide
                                    many of the same benefits, but even today there are still speed
                                    and aesthetic benefits to having natively implemented
